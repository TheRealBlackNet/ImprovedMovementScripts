Improved CharacterBody3D Script for First Person (Shooter) for Redot\Godot

Why: a new user complained that the CharacterBody3D ia useless and that is a fact.
The default 3D script only allows for a movement facing in one direction.
With a check for a Camera3D its possible to instant create a FPS controller.

This project also will update the 2D default scripts.
